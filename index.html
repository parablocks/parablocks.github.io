<h1><img src="https://github.com/parablocks/parablocks.github.io/raw/master/logo_close.png" width=25 alt="logo"> Parablocks</h1>
<p>Parablocks is an alternative, highly parallelized Minecraft server. It is written in C# and uses heavy multithreading to take advantage of modern many-thread CPUs.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Highly threaded pipeline
   <ul>
     <li>Uses different thread(pool)s for each significant task.</li>
     <li>For example, you can assign x threads to handling Player communications, and then assign y tasks to world generation.</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Fully custom and open-source code
   <ul>
     <li>Doesn't depend on Mojang's server, like Bukkit/Spigot/Paper does.</li>
     <li>This also, sadly, breaks all plugins and server-side mods ever made.</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>The state of Parablocks</h2>
<p>Parablocks is a very new project. The server currently does not have any releases, and has very few features implemented. This website is a draft/concept too.</p>

<p>Check back later for more updates.</p>
